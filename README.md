# Zomato_Dashboard
Unlocking the story behind Zomato's numbers, this project turns raw sales data into a visually stunning, user-centric dashboard. By blending the power of PowerBI with the design finesse of Figma, Iâ€™ve crafted a tool that transforms complex insights into clear, actionable strategies.


## Description
Technologies Used:
 - PowerBI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
 - Figma for designing the dashboard layout and user interface.
 - Zomato Sales Dataset for data analysis.

This comprehensive dashboard is designed to provide insights into key metrics related to sales, user performance, and location-specific data. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve built:

**1)** **Welcome Page** - A simple introduction to the dashboard.
**2)** **Sales Analysis** - Detailed visualizations of sales trends across different years, amounts, and cities.
**3)** **User Performance** - Analyzing customer gains and losses over the years.
**4)** **Location Analysis** - Diving into location-specific data, including sales, ratings, orders, and active users.

Working on this project has been a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m thrilled with how it turned out. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š
